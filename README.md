👨‍💻Eco-Analysis-Engine---App – Sustainability Rating System

👨‍💻Eco-Analysis-Engine

Is a desktop-based sustainability evaluation system that allows users to assess, compare, and rank products based on multiple sustainability metrics. The application provides a clean GUI to input product data, automatically calculate a Sustainability Index (SI), assign grades, and visualize comparisons.

This project is ideal as a student software engineering project, demonstrating skills in Java desktop development, data handling, analytics, and visualization.
